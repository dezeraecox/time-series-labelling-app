This repository contains source code for TSLA - the time series labelling app. This streamlit app provides a ⚡ powerfully simply method for manual classification of time series training datasets. The app also provides an example dataset, which can be used to test the labelling, visualisation and download processes.


## Getting started

<!-- To explore this app using the example data, click the "Launch Binder" button above. When prompted to upload a dataset? -->

To explore the functionality of the platform, an example dataset is provided [here](utilities/example_data.csv).

There are two simple ways to use this app on your own data; either entirely online via [Heroku](https://time-series-labelling-app.herokuapp.com/) (*recommended*) or locally on your machine following the installation instructions below.

If you have an issue with the app, would like additional information or have general feedback, get in touch via the [contact form](https://wdile0pdkr7.typeform.com/to/vLqQWI7k) or raise an issue in this repository. Thanks for stopping by!

## Local installation

To use this app locally, first clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/dezeraecox/time-series-labelling-app.git
```

Create a new conda environment and install the required packages, then activate the environment:

```
conda env create -f environment. yml
conda activate tsla_env
```

Navigate to the repository, then start the app:

```
cd ....../time-series-labelling-app/
streamlit run app.py
```

The app should then open in your prefered browser, at which point you can follow the integrated instructions using the example data provided or your own dataset.
